# AI Team - GitHub Organization

## 📌 Objective
The AI Team is dedicated to building an intelligent system that enhances the coding experience by analyzing submitted code, detecting errors, and providing logical insights rather than direct answers. Our model should:
- Identify syntax and logical errors in code.
- Provide meaningful debugging insights to help users understand their mistakes.
- Generate coding questions based on the user's skill level to encourage learning.
- Seamlessly integrate with the website for real-time interaction.

## 🚀 Project Overview
We are developing an AI-powered system that:
- Identifies errors in code submissions.
- Provides logical reasoning to help users debug their code.
- Generates new coding challenges tailored to the user’s proficiency level.
- Integrates smoothly with the main platform (similar to LeetCode or HackerRank).

## 🏗️ Current Scope
- **Model Selection & Training:** Developing and fine-tuning an AI model for code analysis.
- **Dataset Collection:** Gathering a comprehensive dataset for training the model.
- **Error Detection Mechanism:** Implementing techniques to identify syntax and logical errors.
- **Insightful Feedback System:** Designing a system that provides meaningful debugging insights.
- **Adaptive Question Generation:** Implementing a model that generates coding challenges suited to the user's skill level.
- **Integration with Web Platform:** Ensuring smooth API communication with the main website.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow
- **Model:** Custom-trained AI model (Exploring options like Mistral AI, CodeBERT, or other LLMs)
- **Dataset:** Open-source coding datasets + custom-labeled data
- **Deployment:** Docker, FastAPI (for API), AWS/GCP for hosting
